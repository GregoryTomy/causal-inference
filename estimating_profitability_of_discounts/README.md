# Analyzing the Impact of Discounts on E-commerce Profits through Causal Inference
 
In this project, we focus on applying causal inference techniques to determine the effect of discounts on an e-commerce company's profits. The project highlights the challenges of bias in estimating the impact of discounts and demonstrates methods to adjust for this bias to obtain more accurate results. The goal of this study is to present a recommendation on whether the company should distribute its discounts.

Key Learning Points:

**Understanding Bias in Discount Analysis**: We explore how biases can distort our understanding of the discount's effects.
**Bias Adjustment Techniques**: The project employs linear regression and other methods to adjust for bias, improving the quality and reliability of our data analysis.
**Practical Application**: By analyzing real e-commerce scenarios, we gain insights into the practical applications of causal inference in a business context.
